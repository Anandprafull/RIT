“The simplest way to understand how AI and ML relate to each other is: AI is the broader concept of enabling a machine or system to sense, reason, act, or adapt like a human. ML is an application of AI that allows machines to extract knowledge from 
logic to simulate the reasoning that people use to learn from new information 
and make decisions 
Cyber security is primarily about people, processes, and technologies working 
together to encompass the full range of threat reduction, vulnerability reduction, 
deterrence, international engagement, incident response, resiliency, and recovery 
law enforcement, etc.”
