Program 1: Array Operations
Q1: What is the difference between an array and a linked list?
A1: An array has a fixed size and elements are stored contiguously in memory, making it efficient for accessing elements by index. A linked list has a dynamic size and stores elements in nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. Arrays allow constant-time access, while linked lists allow efficient insertions and deletions.

Q2: How do you insert an element in an array at a given position?
A2: To insert an element at a given position, you shift the elements starting from the end of the array to the given position and then insert the new element in the vacant position.

Q3: What happens when you delete an element from an array?
A3: When you delete an element, you shift all the elements after it one position to the left to fill the gap, and the size of the array is reduced.

Program 2: Employee Structure
Q1: How do you define a structure in C?
A1: A structure is defined using the struct keyword. It groups related data of different types under a single name. Example:

c
Copy
struct Employee {
    char name[50];
    int id;
    char dept[30];
    float salary;
};
Q2: What is dynamic memory allocation for a structure?
A2: Dynamic memory allocation uses functions like malloc or calloc to allocate memory at runtime for structures. This allows for variable-sized structures, unlike static allocation.

Q3: How can you access structure members through pointers?
A3: You can access structure members through a pointer using the -> operator. Example: emp_ptr->salary accesses the salary member of the structure pointed to by emp_ptr.

Program 3: Stack Implementation
Q1: What is stack overflow and underflow?
A1: Stack overflow occurs when you try to push an element onto a full stack. Stack underflow occurs when you try to pop an element from an empty stack.

Q2: How would you check for a palindrome using a stack?
A2: A string can be checked for palindrome by pushing each character onto the stack and then comparing the string with the characters popped from the stack. If both match, it’s a palindrome.

Q3: What is the main difference between stack operations and queue operations?
A3: A stack follows Last In, First Out (LIFO) order, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. A queue follows First In, First Out (FIFO) order, where the first element added is the first one to be removed.

Program 4: Infix to Postfix Conversion
Q1: What is the purpose of using a stack in infix to postfix conversion?
A1: The stack is used to temporarily hold operators and ensure correct precedence and associativity when converting infix to postfix expression. This helps in properly placing operators after their operands in the postfix notation.

Q2: How do you handle parentheses during the conversion?
A2: Parentheses are used to control the precedence of operators. When encountering an opening parenthesis (, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing parenthesis ) is encountered, operators are popped from the stack and added to the postfix expression until an opening parenthesis is found.

Program 5: Postfix Expression Evaluation
Q1: How does the stack help in evaluating a postfix expression?
A1: The stack is used to store operands. When an operator is encountered, operands are popped from the stack, the operation is performed, and the result is pushed back onto the stack. At the end, the stack will contain the result of the postfix expression.

Q2: What happens when you encounter an operator during evaluation?
A2: When an operator is encountered, two operands are popped from the stack, the operation is performed, and the result is pushed back onto the stack.

Program 6: Recursion Applications
Q1: How does recursive binary search work?
A1: In recursive binary search, the middle element of the array is compared with the target. If they match, the search ends. If the target is smaller, the search continues on the left half, and if larger, on the right half.

Q2: Can you explain the Tower of Hanoi problem and its recursive solution?
A2: The Tower of Hanoi problem involves moving disks from one peg to another, following specific rules. The recursive solution moves n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, then moves the largest disk to the target peg, and finally moves the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.

Program 7: Call Holding in a Call Centre
Q1: What data structure would you use to manage calls in a call center?
A1: A queue is used to manage calls since it follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, which is ideal for handling phone calls in the order they arrive.

Q2: How do you add and remove calls in the queue?
A2: Calls are added to the queue using the enqueue operation and removed using the dequeue operation. Calls are processed in the order they arrive, ensuring the first call gets serviced first.

Program 8: Circular Queue using Structure
Q1: What is the difference between a circular queue and a regular queue?
A1: A regular queue is linear and may waste space when the front pointer reaches the end of the array. A circular queue wraps around, reusing vacant spaces when the front reaches the end, making more efficient use of the array.

Q2: How do you detect if the circular queue is full?
A2: A circular queue is full when (rear + 1) % MAX == front, meaning there is no space left to add new elements.

Program 9: Linked List for Sorted Names
Q1: How do you maintain a sorted linked list while inserting a new name?
A1: To maintain the sorted order, you traverse the list until you find the correct position for the new name (based on alphabetical order) and insert it there.

Q2: How do you delete a name from a sorted linked list?
A2: To delete a name, you traverse the list to find the node containing the name. Once found, you adjust the pointers of the previous node to bypass the node to be deleted.

Program 10: Stack using Linked List
Q1: How does stack implementation differ when using a linked list compared to an array?
A1: In a linked list-based stack, the stack grows dynamically as nodes are added or removed. It does not have the fixed size limitation of an array-based stack, but there is extra overhead due to pointer management.

Q2: What are the advantages of using a linked list to implement a stack?
A2: A linked list stack has no size limit (other than memory constraints) and does not require resizing, unlike array-based stacks which can suffer from overflow when full.

Program 11: Doubly Linked List Implementation
Q1: How is a doubly linked list different from a singly linked list?
A1: A doubly linked list has two pointers in each node: one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node, allowing traversal in both directions. A singly linked list only has a pointer to the next node.

Q2: How do you delete a node from a doubly linked list?
A2: To delete a node, adjust the next pointer of the previous node and the prev pointer of the next node to bypass the node to be deleted.

Program 12: Binary Search Tree Implementation
Q1: How does a binary search tree maintain its order?
A1: In a binary search tree, the left child of a node has a smaller value, and the right child has a larger value. This ensures that in-order traversal produces values in sorted order.

Q2: What is the time complexity of searching in a binary search tree?
A2: The time complexity of searching in a binary search tree is O(log n) on average, but it can degrade to O(n) in the worst case if the tree is unbalanced.

Certainly! Here's a set of theoretical questions and answers related to the topics in your lab exam:

Program 1: Array Operations
Q1: What is an array in C?
A1: An array in C is a collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. It is a static data structure, meaning its size is fixed at the time of declaration.

Q2: What is the time complexity of inserting an element at a specific position in an array?
A2: The time complexity for insertion is O(n) because after inserting the element at the specified position, all subsequent elements need to be shifted to maintain the array’s structure.

Q3: What are the limitations of arrays in C?
A3: Arrays have a fixed size, meaning you cannot change the size once defined. Additionally, inserting or deleting elements requires shifting the rest of the elements, which can be inefficient for large datasets.

Program 2: Employee Structure
Q1: What is a structure in C?
A1: A structure is a user-defined data type in C that allows grouping of variables of different types under a single name. It provides a way to represent a record (e.g., employee, student, etc.).

Q2: How do you dynamically allocate memory for a structure?
A2: Memory for a structure can be dynamically allocated using functions like malloc() or calloc(). For example:

c
Copy
struct Employee *emp = (struct Employee*) malloc(sizeof(struct Employee));
Q3: Why is it useful to pass a structure by reference (using pointers)?
A3: Passing structures by reference (using pointers) is efficient because it avoids copying the entire structure, especially when the structure is large. It allows functions to modify the original data.

Program 3: Stack Implementation
Q1: What is a stack data structure?
A1: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added (pushed) and removed (popped) from the top of the stack only.

Q2: What are the main operations of a stack?
A2: The main operations of a stack are:

Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes the top element from the stack.
Peek/Top: Retrieves the top element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Checks whether the stack is empty.
Q3: Explain the concept of stack overflow and underflow.
A3: Stack overflow occurs when more elements are pushed onto a full stack. Stack underflow occurs when an attempt is made to pop from an empty stack.

Program 4: Infix to Postfix Conversion
Q1: What is infix notation?
A1: Infix notation is the common arithmetic expression format where operators are placed between operands, e.g., A + B.

Q2: Why is postfix notation preferred in computer processing?
A2: Postfix notation (or Reverse Polish Notation) does not require parentheses to indicate operation precedence, making it easier to evaluate using a stack. Each operator follows its operands, which simplifies the evaluation process.

Q3: What is the precedence of operators in infix to postfix conversion?
A3: Operator precedence determines the order in which operations are performed. For example, in most programming languages:

* and / have higher precedence than + and -.
Parentheses have the highest precedence.
Program 5: Postfix Expression Evaluation
Q1: What is postfix notation?
A1: Postfix notation is an expression format where operators follow their operands. For example, A + B in infix becomes A B + in postfix.

Q2: What are the steps to evaluate a postfix expression using a stack?
A2: The steps to evaluate a postfix expression are:

Read the expression from left to right.
Push operands onto the stack.
When an operator is encountered, pop the top two operands, apply the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.
At the end, the stack contains the result.
Program 6: Recursion Applications
Q1: What is recursion in programming?
A1: Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Each recursive call reduces the problem size until a base case is reached, at which point the function stops calling itself.

Q2: What is the difference between a base case and a recursive case in recursion?
A2: The base case is the condition under which the recursion stops (e.g., the function does not call itself anymore). The recursive case is the part of the function where it calls itself with a modified argument to solve a smaller part of the problem.

Q3: What is the time complexity of binary search?
A3: The time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements. This is because the search space is halved with each comparison.

Program 7: Call Holding in a Call Centre
Q1: What is a queue data structure?
A1: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added to the rear and removed from the front.

A2: The primary operations of a queue are:

Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes an element from the front of the queue.
Front: Retrieves the front element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.
Q3: Why is a queue suitable for managing calls in a call center?
A3: A queue is suitable for managing calls because it follows the FIFO principle, ensuring that calls are processed in the order they arrive, providing fair and efficient service.

Program 8: Circular Queue using Structure
Q1: What is the difference between a linear queue and a circular queue?
A1: In a linear queue, the queue can become full even if there is space at the beginning of the queue. In a circular queue, the last element wraps around to the front, ensuring better space utilization and avoiding the wastage of memory.

Q2: What is the main advantage of using a circular queue?
A2: The main advantage is that a circular queue avoids the problem of wasted space when the rear pointer reaches the end of the queue. It reuses empty spaces created by dequeued elements.
